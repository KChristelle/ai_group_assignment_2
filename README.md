### Overview 

One of the goals RRA would like to accomplish with this challenge is to digitize their data on collected revenue.<br> 
This is due to the deterioration of the tax figures by over 10%, the value of US 1.3 Billion Dollars.<br> 
To achieve their goal, RRA needs to see what data can be used for and how it can help them draw better conclusions every year. <br> For this challenge, we will need to find a dataset from an African country to demonstrate what the RRA can do with tax revenue data.<br> 
Once the dataset has been found and cleaned, it will be used to demonstrate visualizations that could be potentially used and accomplished with data from Rwanda as well.
